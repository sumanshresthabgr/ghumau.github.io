    <h1>WELCOME TO KOREA</h1>
    <p class="ttx">
      South Korea is one of Asia’s most exciting travel destinations, offering
      a perfect mix of modern cities, traditional culture, and beautiful
      natural landscapes. Visitors can explore Seoul’s famous attractions such
      as Gyeongbokgung Palace, Bukchon Hanok Village, Myeongdong shopping
      streets, and the stunning views from N Seoul Tower. For beach lovers,
      Busan offers Haeundae Beach, Gamcheon Culture Village, and fresh seafood
      markets. Jeju Island is a must-visit paradise known for its volcanic
      landscapes, waterfalls, lava caves, and relaxing beaches. Nature
      travelers can enjoy Nami Island, Seoraksan National Park, and Gangwon’s
      scenic mountains. Other cultural cities like Gyeongju, Incheon, and
      Daegu add even more history, temples, and coastal beauty. With easy
      transportation, safe streets, and endless places to explore, Korea is a
      top destination for travelers around the world.

      <div id="text-area">
        <p>
          Jeju Island feels like a completely different world compared to the
          busy cities of Korea. As soon as you arrive, the pace slows down and
          everything feels calmer; the air is fresh, the ocean is bright blue,
          and the scenery looks straight out of a postcard. <br><br> Travelers love
          starting their day watching the sunrise at Seongsan Ilchulbong, then
          exploring Jeju’s famous waterfalls and lava caves that show the
          island’s volcanic history.

      <div id="text-area">
        <p>
         Gamcheon is more than just a pretty village—it’s a place where history
        and creativity meet. The village was once home to refugees after the
        Korean War, and today its buildings, staircases, and pathways tell the
        story of community life. <br><br> Over the years, local artists added murals and
        installations, turning the area into a cultural landmark. Travelers love
        the playful art pieces, themed houses, souvenir shops, and panoramic
        viewpoints. Whether you’re exploring alone or with friends, the
        village’s charm makes it a memorable part of any Busan trip.
